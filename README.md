Rotate Matrix
Write a function that rotates a NxN matrix 90 degrees clockwise.
A matrix, also called a 2-D array, is simply an array of arrays of values.

2x2 MATRIX EXAMPLE:

[ [1, 2],
[3, 4] ]

Rotated:

[ [3, 1],
[4, 2] ]

4x4 MATRIX EXAMPLE:

[ [ 1, 2, 3, 4],
[ 5, 6, 7, 8],
[ 9, “A”,”B”,”C”],
[“D”,”E”,”F”,”G”] ]

Rotated:

[ [“D”, 9, 5, 1],
[“E”, “A”, 6, 2],
[“F”,”B”, 7, 3],
[“G”,”C”, 8, 4] ]
